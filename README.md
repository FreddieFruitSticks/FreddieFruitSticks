- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FreddieFruitSticks. I am a software engineer at TwitchTV (as of this writing 2021) as a member of the video on demand team.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the fundamentals of almost anything. I am always working on a side project that will help me understand this complex world of software engineering a little better.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how bitcoin, and blockchain technology in general, functions under the hood. 
I am building my own blockchain, cryptocurrency and a mini blockchain explorer to better understand the fundamentals of the blockchain ecosystem. This is for interest and educational purposes only.
