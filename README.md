- 👋 Hi, I’m @FreddieFruitSticks. I am a software engineer at TwitchTV (as of this writing 2021) as a member of the video on demand team.
- 👀 I’m interested in the fundamentals of almost anything. I am always working on a side project that will help me understand this complex world of software engineering a little better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how bitcoin, and blockchain technology in general, functions under the hood. 
I am building my own blockchain, cryptocurrency and a mini blockchain explorer to better help me understand the fundamentals of the blockchain technology. This is for interest
and educational purposes only.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to blockchains
- 📫 How to reach me: freddieodonnell[at]gmail[dot]com
